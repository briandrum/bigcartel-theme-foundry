<p><strong>WHAT&rsquo;S &nbsp;WITH THE NAME?<br /></strong>Long before we moved here, my mother-in-law would bring my nephew to Chagrin Falls to see the sights and get ice cream at the Popcorn Shop. He was just a little guy then, and called it &ldquo;sugar and frogs&rdquo;.</p>
<strong>DO YOU HAVE A STOREFRONT?</strong><br />We are a tiny operation, and have no permanent location other than this online shop. Geiger&rsquo;s used to carry some of our shirts, and you can find some of our stickers at Off the Wagon.
<p><strong>CAN I EXCHANGE FOR A DIFFERENT SIZE?</strong><br />Yes, I want you to love your shirt so if we have it in stock I&rsquo;ll be happy to exchange it or give you a full refund.</p>
<p><strong>DO YOU DO YOUR OWN SCREENPRINTING?</strong><br />No, I focus more on the concept and design end of things, and outsource the screen-printing to the experts.</p>
