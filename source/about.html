<p>I started Sugar&amp;Frogs after moving to Chagrin Falls in 2016 and I couldn't find a decent shirt for my new home. The designs were lacking, they were printed in thick, uncomfortable plastisol, and usually on cheap, boxy cotton tees.</p>
<p>So I set about creating shirts that are better in every way. It starts with high-quality combed, ring-spun cotton and cotton-poly blend tees. All our original designs are screen printed using durable, beautiful water-based inks that actually dye the fabric, so they never crack or peel and after a few washes you can&rsquo;t even feel it any more.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make any money, but it does allow me to support a bunch of local organizations by doing something I really enjoy. I&rsquo;ve made or donated shirts and stickers to Safe Routes Chagrin, The Rec, Trike &amp; Bike, PTO, Boosters, and CAA Travel Baseball, and raised money at pop-up shops for After Prom and Boosters.</p>
<p>Please get in touch if you have an organization that could use some help.</p>
